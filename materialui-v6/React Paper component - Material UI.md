## [Introduction](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-card/#introduction)

In Material Design, surface components and shadow styles are heavily influenced by their real-world physical counterparts.

MaterialÂ UI implements this concept with the Paper component, a container-like surface that features the [`elevation`](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-card/#elevation) prop for pulling box-shadow values from the theme.

## [Component](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-card/#component)

```jsx
import Paper from '@mui/material/Paper';
```

## [Customization](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-card/#customization)

### [Elevation](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-card/#elevation)

Use the `elevation` prop to establish hierarchy through the use of shadows. The Paper component's default elevation level is `1`. The prop accepts values from `0` to `24`. The higher the number, the further away the Paper appears to be from its background.

In dark mode, increasing the elevation also makes the background color lighter. This is done by applying a semi-transparent gradient with the `background-image` CSS property.

elevation=0

elevation=1

elevation=2

elevation=3

elevation=4

elevation=6

elevation=8

elevation=12

elevation=16

elevation=24

elevation=0

elevation=1

elevation=2
