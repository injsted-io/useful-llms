The Bottom Navigation bar allows movement between primary destinations in an app.

Bottom navigation bars display three to five destinations at the bottom of a screen. Each destination is represented by an icon and an optional text label. When a bottom navigation icon is tapped, the user is taken to the top-level navigation destination associated with that icon.

This demo keeps bottom navigation fixed to the bottom, no matter the amount of content on-screen.

## [Third-party routing library](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-card/#third-party-routing-library)

One frequent use case is to perform navigation on the client only, without an HTTP round-trip to the server. The `BottomNavigationAction` component provides the `component` prop to handle this use case. Here is a [more detailed guide](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/integrations/routing/).
