## [Accessibility](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-card/#accessibility)

(WAI-ARIA: [https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/))

Be sure to add a `aria-label` description on the `Breadcrumbs` component.

The accessibility of this component relies on:

-   The set of links is structured using an ordered list (`<ol>` element).
-   To prevent screen reader announcement of the visual separators between links, they are hidden with `aria-hidden`.
-   A nav element labeled with `aria-label` identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate.

### [Page Container](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-card/#page-container)

The [PageContainer](https://mui.com/toolpad/core/react-page-container/) component in `@toolpad/core` is the ideal wrapper for the content of your dashboard. It makes the MaterialÂ UI Container navigation-aware and extends it with page title, breadcrumbs, actions, and more.
