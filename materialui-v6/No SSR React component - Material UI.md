## [Introduction](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-no-ssr/#introduction)

No-SSR is a utility component that prevents its children from being rendered on the server, deferring their rendering to the client instead. This can be useful in a variety of situations, including:

-   To create an escape hatch for broken dependencies that don't support server-side rendering (SSR)
-   To improve the time to first paint by only rendering above the fold
-   To reduce the rendering time on the server
-   To turn on service degradation when the server load is too heavy
-   To improve the Time to Interactive (TTI) by only rendering what's important (using the `defer` prop)

### [Delay client-side rendering](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-no-ssr/#delay-client-side-rendering)

You can also use No-SSR to delay the rendering of specific components on the client-sideâ€”for example, to let the rest of the application load before an especially complex or data-heavy component.

The following demo shows how to use the `defer` prop to prioritize rendering the rest of the app outside of what is nested within No-SSR:
