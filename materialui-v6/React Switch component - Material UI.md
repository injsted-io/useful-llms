Switches toggle the state of a single setting on or off.

Switches are the preferred way to adjust settings on mobile. The option that the switch controls, as well as the state it's in, should be made clear from the corresponding inline label.

## [Switches with FormGroup](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/all-components/#switches-with-formgroup)

`FormGroup` is a helpful wrapper used to group selection controls components that provides an easier API. However, you are encouraged to use [Checkboxes](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/react-checkbox/) instead if multiple related controls are required. (See: [When to use](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/all-components/#when-to-use)).

## [Customization](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/all-components/#customization)

Here are some examples of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the [overrides documentation page](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/customization/how-to-customize/).

## [Accessibility](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/all-components/#accessibility)

-   It will render an element with the `checkbox` role not `switch` role since this role isn't widely supported yet. Please test first if assistive technology of your target audience supports this role properly. Then you can change the role with `<Switch inputProps={{ role: 'switch' }}>`
-   All form controls should have labels, and this includes radio buttons, checkboxes, and switches. In most cases, this is done by using the `<label>` element ([FormControlLabel](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/api/form-control-label/)).
-   When a label can't be used, it's necessary to add an attribute directly to the input component. In this case, you can apply the additional attribute (for example `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `title`) via the `inputProps` prop.

```jsx
<Switch value="checkedA" inputProps={{ 'aria-label': 'Switch A' }} />
```

## [Unstyled](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/all-components/#unstyled)

Use the [BaseÂ UIÂ Switch](https://v6.mui.com/base-ui/react-switch/) for complete ownership of the component's design, with no MaterialÂ UI or JoyÂ UI styles to override. This unstyled version of the component is the ideal choice for heavy customization with a smaller bundle size.
